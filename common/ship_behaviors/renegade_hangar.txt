# and increase the number of ships instead
# So that they don't move around clumped up

# We can also solve it by simply having lots of hangars with different behaviors
# and attack_ranges and attack_move_patterns

# Not sure how to get more than 3, but haven't tested yet.
# Fear that the slots on the section will be filled by just one type
